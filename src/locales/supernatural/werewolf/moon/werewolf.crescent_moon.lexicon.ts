      Shadow Gaze (•)\n
      This Facet forces the Shadow to spill forth its secrets before the baleful gaze of the Ithaeur.\n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Duration: 1 scene \n
      The Ithaeur adds her Wisdom Renown to all Empathy rolls made when interacting with spirits and the Ridden. Shadow Gaze can also be used directly against any spirit that the Ithaeur can perceive, revealing the symbolic truth buried at its heart. Second and subsequent uses of this ability in the scene cost 1 Essence each. \n
      Dice Pool: Wits + Occult + Wisdom versus Resistance \n
      Action: Instant, may be Contested \n
      
      Roll Results
      • Dramatic Failure: The Ithaeur is unable to read the spirit, and the spirit becomes aware of the Ithaeur’s attempt to do so.\n
      • Failure: The Ithaeur is unable to read the spirit.\n
      • Success: The Ithaeur learns the spirit’s ban or bane.\n
      • Exceptional Success: The Ithaeur learns both the spirit’s ban and bane.\n
      
      \n
      SPIRIT WHISPERS (••)\n
      The Ithaeur can whisper a command that stirs sleeping spirits to mutter their secrets.\n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Dice Pool: Presence + Persuasion + Wisdom \n
      Action: Instant \n
      The Ithaeur may use Spirit Whispers against a single object or dormant spirit that she can perceive and that can hear her words. She phrases a simple question of at most one sentence. This is generally used to ask the sleeping spirit of a mundane object (such as a door, traffic light, or so forth) for information relating to its immediate area of influence.\n

      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The spirit gives the Ithaeur an outright false or misleading answer.\n
      • Failure: The spirit remains dormant and does not reply.\n
      • Success: The spirit whispers a short, one-sentence answer to the Ithaeur’s question. It can only provide information about its immediate environs or influence — a door’s slumbering spirit might know the code that humans use to open it, and descriptions of who has passed through recently, but that is all. “I don’t know” is a perfectly valid answer.\n
      • Exceptional Success: The spirit provides a longer answer, not limited to just one sentence.\n

      \n
      SHADOW HUNTER (•••) \n
      When the pack howls the Hunt, it is the Ithaeur who leads the chase through the Shadow and who corners spirit-prey. This Facet can only be activated when the Ithaeur gains the Siskur-Dah Condition.\n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Dice Pool: This power requires no roll \n
      Action: Instant \n
      Duration: The full duration of Siskur-Dah \n
      For the duration of the Facet’s effects, the Ithaeur adds her Wisdom Renown to the following dice pools as long as she is in the Shadow and taking actions to pursue the Siskur-Dah’s prey: \n
      • Perception rolls \n
      • Rolls to resist spirit Numina and Dread Powers \n
      • Rolls to travel or chase through the Shadow \n

      \n
      SHADOW MASQUERADE (••••) \n
      The Ithaeur dons the Essence of a spirit like a mask. She passes amongst the denizens of the Shadow as one of their own.\n
      Cost: 2 Essence \n
      Dice Pool: Manipulation + Occult + Wisdom versus Resistance \n
      Action: Instant \n
      Duration: 1 hour per success \n
      The Ithaeur may use this Facet against a single spirit that she can perceive.\n
      
      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The Ithaeur fails to mimic the spirit, and gains the Ban Condition (see p. 306). The ban she gains corresponds to the spirit’s own ban.\n
      • Failure: The Ithaeur fails to mimic the spirit.\n
      • Success: The Ithaeur copies a number of Influence dots from the spirit equal to successes rolled, as well as gaining either its ban or bane. She uses her Shadow Masquerade dice pool for copied Influence use. To other spirits, the Ithaeur appears as a spirit of the same type as the prey as long as she acts in an appropriate fashion. If she behaves suspiciously, other spirits may make a Finesse + Resistance roll penalized by the Rank of the mimicked spirit to pierce the deception. If this succeeds, Shadow Masquerade immediately ends.\n
      • Exceptional Success: Any attempts by a spirit to see through the illusion are also penalized by the Ithaeur’s Wisdom Renown.\n


      \n
      PANOPTICON (•••••)\n
      The Ithaeur opens the spiritual font of her Essence and reaches out with her consciousness. She leashes the denizens of the Shadow to serve as her eyes and ears.\n
      Cost: Essence equal to the maximum Rank of spirit to be affected \n
      Dice Pool: Intelligence + Occult + Wisdom \n
      Action: Extended (10 successes; each roll represents 1 minute) \n
      Duration: 1 scene; can be extended for an additional 1 Essence per scene \n
      \n
      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The Ithaeur’s senses are overloaded and she gains the Confused Condition.\n
      • Failure: The Ithaeur accumulates no successes and gains the Stumbled Condition.\n
      • Success: The Ithaeur accumulates successes. If the target is met, the Ithaeur immediately becomes aware of all spirits of up to the maximum Rank targeted within Wisdom Renown × 100 yards, and suffers a –3 penalty to her own Perception rolls for the Facet’s duration. The Ithaeur gains a rough indication of what each spirit perceives, whether they are in combat or injured, and so forth. As an Instant action, the Ithaeur may focus on a single spirit and fully immerse herself in (or withdraw from) that spirit’s senses. This blocks out her own senses and those of the other spirits in the panopticon. She perceives everything that the spirit does with perfect clarity, and may spend a point of Essence to apply a penalty equal to her Wisdom Renown to all Perception rolls that the spirit makes for one scene.\n
      • Exceptional Success: The Ithaeur suffers no penalty to Perception from the Facet.
