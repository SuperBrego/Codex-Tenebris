      EVISCERATE (•) \n
      The Irraka’s first strike is often the last of the fight. \n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Action: Reflexive \n
      The Irraka may activate this Facet as part of a Brawl or Weaponry attack against an unaware or surprised opponent, turning her attack into a rote action. \n
      
      \n
      SLIP AWAY (••) \n
      The Irraka may use this Facet to leave no memories of her passing. \n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Action: Instant \n
      Duration: 1 scene \n
      Any character who perceives or interacts with the Irraka while this Facet is active finds it extremely hard to remember her presence. If the Irraka takes no memorable actions toward the individual — she was only a face in a crowd, or a dog in the alley, or the other half of a brief conversation — he simply dismisses any recollection. If the Irraka was memorable — she started a fight, asked extremely strange questions, or engaged in an obviously suspicious activity — or if the witness is prompted to examine his memories closely, he suffers a penalty to any dice pools to remember her equal to the Irraka’s Cunning Renown, even if the witness has an otherwise perfect memory. The witness will not simply forget that he had a fight while guarding a building, but he may forget the details of his opponent or recall only a blur. \n
 
      \n
      RELENTLESS HUNTER (•••) \n
      No matter how well the prey believes that they have secured themselves, the Irraka always finds a way. \n
      This Facet can only be activated when the Irraka gains the Siskur-Dah Condition. \n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Action: Instant \n
      Duration: The full duration of Siskur-Dah \n
      
      For the duration of the Facet’s effects, the Irraka adds her Cunning Renown to the following dice pools as long as she is taking actions to pursue the Siskur-Dah’s prey: \n
      • Stealth dice pools against the prey. \n
      • Attempts to overcome any obstructions and security the prey may have placed between themselves and danger, such as Larceny rolls to break into a building where they are hiding. \n
      • Dice pools to determine entry points to boltholes where the prey are hiding, alternate paths to reach them, and other means of getting to the prey despite their best efforts. \n

      \n
      DIVIDE AND CONQUER (••••) \n
      The Irraka sees no need to attack the prey when they are strong and numerous. Better by far to pull them apart with distractions and lures, then pick them off one by one. \n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Dice Pool: Manipulation + Subterfuge + Cunning versus prey’s Composure + Primal Urge \n
      Action: Contested \n
      The Irraka may use this Facet on a single individual whom he can see and who is part of a group. The Irraka has to supply some sort of distraction of movement or sound as part of the Facet, but it can be incredibly minor and only the chosen target will notice it — at least at first. \n
      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The prey becomes fearful, gaining the Spooked Condition and desperately clinging to the company of her fellows. \n
      • Failure: The Facet fails. \n
      • Success: The prey gains the Lured Condition. She will willingly split up from the group and leave their immediate presence to investigate, despite her better instincts. \n
      • Exceptional Success: The Facet also affects a number of other characters in the group equal to the Irraka’s Cunning, applying the Lured Condition to them all and scattering them in pursuit of phantasmal figments. \n
    
      \n
      BREACH (•••••) \n
      The Irraka slips across the Gauntlet like a shadow between worlds. \n
      Cost: 3 Essence \n
      Dice Pool: Wits + Stealth + Cunning \n
      Action: Instant \n

      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The Irraka’s attempt to breach the Gauntlet is violently rebuffed. She suffers the player’s choice of the Arm Wrack, Leg Wrack, or Stunned Tilts. \n
      • Failure: The Facet fails and the Irraka is unable to cross the Gauntlet. \n
      • Success: The Irraka breaches the Gauntlet and reaches the other side, arriving at the corresponding point in Flesh or Shadow. The Irraka does not need to be at a locus to do this. \n
      • Exceptional Success: The next time the Irraka uses Breach this scene, it costs her no Essence.
