      KILLER INSTINCT (•)\n
      The Rahu is a Moon-forged killer. This Facet brings his deadly instincts to the fore. \n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Action: Reflexive \n
      Duration: 1 scene \n
      The Rahu benefits from the 8-again rule on Brawl and Weaponry dice pools for the duration of the scene.\n

      \n
      WARRIOR'S HIDE (••)\n
      Battle is a crucible. The Rahu must be tough enough to stand up against the very worst the foe can offer, and deliver a killing blow in return.\n
      Duration: Permanent \n
      The Rahu adds his Purity Renown to his Health, gaining an extra point of Health each time he increases his Purity. This increase is permanent.\n

      \n
      BLOODY-HANDED HUNTER (•••)\n
      A Rahu on the hunt is terrifying to behold — a blood-spattered figure utterly devoted to the kill. Woe betides anyone foolish enough to get in his way.\n
      This Facet can only be activated when the Rahu gains the Siskur-Dah Condition.\n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Action: Instant \n
      Duration: The full duration of Siskur-Dah \n
      For the duration of the Facet’s effects, the Rahu adds his Purity Renown to his attack rolls against anyone who is serving as an obstacle to successfully pursuing Siskur-Dah. Whether the obstacle is an ally of the prey who seeks to kill the Rahu, or just a hapless, troublesome human whose bureaucracy is causing an obstruction, the Rahu gains the bonus. Bloody-Handed Hunter does not grant its bonus to attacks against the Hunt’s prey itself.\n

      \n
      Butchery (••••)\n
      Girded with this Facet, the Rahu exults when faced with many foes. It’s a chance to paint the scene red with slaughter.\n
      Cost: 2 Essence \n
      Dice Pool: Wits + Brawl + Purity \n
      Action: Reflexive \n
      Duration: 1 turn per success \n

      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The blood-hungry Rahu overextends himself. His Defense becomes 0 for one turn, during which he cannot take actions that would involve giving up his Defense.\n
      • Failure: The Facet has no effect.\n
      • Success: For the duration of the Facet and as long as the Rahu is engaging more than one enemy, whenever the Rahu hits a foe with an unarmed attack (including teeth and claws), or is hit by a foe, he may apply one of the following Tilts to it regardless of whether the attack deals any damage: Arm Wrack, Blinded, Deafened, Knocked Down, Leg Wrack. Whenever the Rahu takes an enemy out of the fight by killing it or rendering it incapacitated, the duration of Butchery is extended by a single turn.\n
      • Exceptional Success: The Rahu inflicts three of the Tilts against the first enemy who strikes or is struck by him after activating the Facet.\n

      \n
      CRIMSON SPASM (•••••)\n
      The Rahu lets the full and primal lunacy of the Moon fill him with quicksilver rage. His flesh buckles, warps, and spasms as it twists into a primal form of destruction.\n
      Cost: 1 Essence per turn \n
      Dice Pool: Stamina + Survival + Purity \n
      Action: Instant \n
      
      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The Rahu loses control of the raw lunar power pouring into him. This counts as a breaking point towards Spirit and the Rahu involuntarily shifts into another form.\n
      • Failure: The Facet fails.\n
      • Success: Each success allows the Rahu to add two dots to Strength or Stamina, to add a point of general armor, or to increase the lethal damage done by his natural weapons by +1. These benefits stack on top of those granted by other Facets and forms. The Spasm lasts as long as the Rahu fuels it by paying 1 Essence each turn. If the Rahu uses this Facet while in Hishu or Urhan, he will cause Lunacy in that form as if he were in Dalu.\n
      • Exceptional Success: The Rahu also regenerates a point of lethal damage for free every turn he fuels the Spasm.
