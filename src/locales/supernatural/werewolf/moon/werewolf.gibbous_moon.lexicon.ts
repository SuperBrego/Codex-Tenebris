    WAR HOWL (•)\n

    \n
    VOICE OF GLORY (••)\n
    The voice of the Cahalith is powerful, reassuring, and inspiring. She holds audiences in thrall to her words, both her allies and hapless prey who don’t understand the threat she poses.\n
    Cost: 1 Essence\n
    Action: Instant\n
    Duration: 1 scene\n
    The Cahalith adds her Glory Renown to all her dice pools for Expression and Persuasion.

If she is attempting to inspire or incite violence and aggression, increase her impression by another step.\n

    \n
    DREAM HUNTER (•••)\n
    It doesn’t matter that the prey hides behind thick walls. It doesn’t matter how many guards and traps they have set between themselves and their hunters. When they sleep, when they dream, it is then that the Cahalith comes for them.\n
    This Facet can only be activated when the Cahalith gains the Siskur-Dah Condition.\n
    Cost: 1 Essence\n
    Dice Pool: Manipulation + Empathy + Glory versus Composure + Primal Urge (when invading the prey’s dreams)\n
    Action: Contested\n
    Duration: The full duration of Siskur-Dah\n
    Upon activating this Facet when a hunt begins, the Cahalith becomes attuned to the waking state of her prey. Should her prey fall into deep, dreaming sleep, the Cahalith immediately becomes aware. She may attempt to fall asleep naturally, meditate herself to sleep, or spend 1 Essence to immediately slumber. She then tracks down the prey’s mind in the moonlit dreamscape that her dream-self prowls.\n

    Roll Results\n
    • Dramatic Failure: The Cahalith loses herself in strange, alien dreams of sky and moon, gaining the Exhausted Condition when she wakes.\n
    • Failure: The Cahalith fails to track down the dreams of the prey, and awakens. She may not try again until the prey has woken and then returned to sleep once more.\n
    • Success: The Cahalith follows the dream-spoor of her prey into his subconscious. The prey experiences this as a terrifying wolf that flits through his dreams, and he will remember this when he awakens. The Cahalith may choose one of the following effects:\n
      • Dreams become predatory nightmares, forcing the prey awake. He regains no Willpower from resting, and gains the Exhausted Condition.\n
      • The Cahalith maintains a distant but unnerving presence that plants the seeds of fear, inflicting the Paranoid Condition on the prey when he awakens.\n
      • The prey’s dreams are shaped with Essence, rendering him an inviting target for spirits. He gains the Open Condition.\n
      • The Cahalith hunts through the dream for fragmentary thought-beasts and figments, discovering one of the following about the prey: roughly where the prey is in the physical world, his Blood and Bone (or Vice and Virtue or other equivalent traits), any steps he is taking to try to protect himself from the hunt, an impression of his immediate surroundings.\n
    • Exceptional Success: The Cahalith awakens refreshed and reinvigorated, regaining one spent Willpower point.\n

    \n
    THOUSAND-THROAT HOWL (••••) \n
    The Cahalith throws back her head and howls. A thousand voices cry out with her, throwing prey into confusion and disarray. \n
    Cost: 2 Essence \n
    Dice Pool: Presence + Intimidate + Glory versus Resolve + Primal Urge \n
    Action: Contested \n

    Roll Results \n
    • Dramatic Failure: The Cahalith’s discordant howl chokes and she feels the weight of failure, gaining the Demoralized Condition. \n
    • Failure: The Cahalith’s howl has no effect. \n
    • Success: Any prey who hear the howl and who fail to roll as many successes as the Cahalith are struck by the Demoralized Condition. \n
    • Exceptional Success: All prey suffering the Demoralized Condition also lose one Willpower point. \n

    \n
    END OF STORY (•••••) \n
    The Cahalith knows when it’s time for the story to end and the hunt to come to a gratifying, brutal conclusion. It doesn’t matter whether the prey agrees. He’s doomed already. \n
    Cost: 3 Essence \n
    Dice Pool: Presence + Persuasion + Glory versus prey’s Composure + Primal Urge \n
    Action: Contested \n
    Duration: 1 day \n
    The Cahalith names the prey of this Facet as she relates the victim’s impending fate to her pack-mates. \n

    Roll Results \n
    • Dramatic Failure: The story that is ending may be that of the Cahalith herself. She suffers a penalty to Defense against the prey equal to her own Glory Renown. This bane persists for one day. \n
    • Failure: The Facet fails. \n
    • Success: Doom falls upon the prey. If he flees or hides from the Uratha or her packmates, he suffers a penalty to Speed, chase rolls, and Stealth rolls equal to the Cahalith’s Glory Renown. He suffers her Glory Renown as a penalty to his Initiative if he faces her in combat, as well as to his Defense against her attacks. The first time in a scene that he deals damage to the Cahalith or her packmates, the damage inflicted is also reduced by her Glory Renown. \n
    • Exceptional Success: The Cahalith gains the Inspired Condition.
