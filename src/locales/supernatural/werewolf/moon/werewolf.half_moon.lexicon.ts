      SCENT BENEATH THE SURFACE (•) \n
      The keen senses of the Elodoth thresh truth from the chaff of lies with ease. \n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Dice Pool: Wits + Empathy + Honor versus Composure + Primal Urge \n
      Action: Contested \n
      Duration: 1 scene \n
      The Elodoth can use this Facet after at least one turn of conversation with or observation of another character. \n
      
      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The Elodoth believes whatever the prey says as the truth; after all, his keen senses would never lie. \n
      • Failure: The Facet fails. \n
      • Success: The Elodoth can sense whether the prey’s words and actions are deceptive or truthful. He can discern whether they are lying outright or by omission, if they are attempting to mislead or trying to dissemble. \n
      • Exceptional Success: It becomes trivially obvious how to manipulate the prey. For the remainder of the scene, the Elodoth can add his Honor Renown to all Manipulation-based dice pools targeting the prey. \n

      \n
      BINDING OATH (••) \n
      The world is a network of favors, dominance, and submission. With this Facet, the Elodoth can strengthen those ties with Essence. \n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Dice Pool: Resolve + Persuasion + Honor versus Resolve + Primal Urge \n
      Action: Contested \n
      Duration: 1 month \n
      The Elodoth can use this Facet as part of a binding oath on an agreement between two parties. He may be one of the agreeing parties, or may oversee the pact for others. Sealing the oath requires a symbolic act from those swearing to it — such as signing a document or cutting palms and shaking hands. Usually this oath is voluntarily taken but, when an Elodoth attempts to trick another into such an agreement, the victim of the subterfuge subconsciously attempts to resist the roll. \n

      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The Elodoth’s will is not strong enough to bind the oath, and breaking it proves the strength of those whom he would have chained. The first party to break the oath regains two spent Willpower points. \n
      • Failure: The Elodoth fails to bind the parties to the oath. \n
      • Success: The Elodoth’s will binds both parties. Any attempts to break the oath by either party must fight against the Facet’s power. An action that would break the oath, even unknowingly, suffers a penalty to its dice pool equal to the Elodoth’s Honor Renown. This penalty represents circumstances conspiring against the would-be oathbreaker as the world flings obstacles in their path. \n
      • Exceptional Success: The Elodoth becomes immediately aware if the oath is broken, and by which party. \n

      \n
      SLY HUNTER (•••) \n
      The Elodoth hunts with a net wrought not of rope but of connections, favors, and allies. It is so terribly easy for the prey to become snared. \n
      This Facet can only be activated when the Elodoth gains the Siskur-Dah Condition. \n
      Cost: 1 Essence \n
      Action: Instant \n
      Duration: The full duration of Siskur-Dah \n
      For the duration of the Facet’s effects, the Elodoth adds his Honor Renown to the following dice pools as long as he is taking actions to pursue the Siskur-Dah’s prey: \n
      • Actions involving his Allies and Contacts to track down the prey or obstruct them. \n
      • Social rolls to attack or hamper the prey’s own Allies, Alternate Identity, Contacts, Resources, and Status Merits. \n

      \n
      TIES OF WORD AND PROMISE (••••) \n
      The Elodoth needs only a little time to draw on the strands of his web. It takes but a few moments of convincing promises and assurances. \n
      Cost: 1 Essence per Merit dot \n
      Dice Pool: Manipulation + Persuasion + Honor \n
      Action: Extended (10 successes; each roll represents 1 minute) \n
      Duration: 1 day \n
      The Elodoth chooses Allies, Alternate Identity, Contacts, Resources, or Status when using this Facet, spending 1 Essence per dot of the new Merit that he wishes to gain. The group with which he gains the new Merit must be one that he or his existing Allies and Contacts have some sort of friendly link to. He must also contact at least one member of the group to use this Facet through. Attempting to gain dots in a Merit with a group that is explicitly hostile to him imposes a –3 penalty on the roll. \n

      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The Elodoth is rebuffed, and the targeted group attempts to block an existing Ally or Contact Merit that he possesses. \n
      • Failure: The Elodoth accumulates no successes and gains the Stumbled Condition. \n
      • Success: The Elodoth accumulates successes. If the target is met, the Elodoth gains the desired Merit for one day. \n
      • Exceptional Success: The Elodoth gains the Merit for one week. \n

      \n
      TIES OF BLOOD AND BONE (•••••) \n
      The strongest ties of all are those that bind the pack together. This Facet lets the Elodoth draw on those connections at a deep and visceral level, exchanging places in a shiver of fleshy metamorphosis. \n
      Cost: 3 Essence \n
      Dice Pool: Stamina + Empathy + Honor versus Stamina + Primal Urge \n
      Action: Instant, may be Contested \n
      When using this Facet, the Elodoth chooses a single packmate within his Honor Renown in miles. If the packmate wishes to resist the Facet, she may do so with her Resolve + Primal Urge. If the Elodoth chooses a packmate out of range, the Facet simply fails. \n
      
      Roll Results \n
      • Dramatic Failure: The Facet fails, and the backlash of metamorphic power inflicts the Arm Wrack or Leg Wrack Tilt on the Elodoth. \n
      • Failure: The Facet fails to work. \n
      • Success: In a moment of shifting flesh and bone, the Elodoth and packmate simply become each other, exchanging places. Both retain all garb and equipment they were previously carrying. This facet does not give the Elodoth awareness of his packmate’s condition or situation before the exchange. \n
      • Exceptional Success: Both the Elodoth and packmate heal two points of lethal or bashing damage during the exchange.
